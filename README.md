# Technical notes

* This repository stores all notes related to programming best practices, new technologies, design patterns taken during self-learning
* This is also a self-exploration into Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
* Best viewed in Obsidian app - where each folder acts as a "vault" - to make the most of "links" and "back-links"
* "Links" and "Back-links" dont work across folders
