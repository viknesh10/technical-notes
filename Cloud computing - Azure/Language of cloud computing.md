## High availability
* This feature is core to the cloud
* You dont own the hardware
* You can add more servers with a click
* If a hardware fails, you can instantantly replace it
* Use clusters to ensure high availability

## Reliability
* AKA Fault tolerance or Disaster recovery
* Resilience
	* The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
* Deploy in multiple locations
	* Global-scale computing
	* Protects against regional failure/disaster
* No single point of failure
	* Resources in multiple locations
	* If one system goes down, the other picks up the load

## Scalability
* Automatically adjust resources to meet demand
* Dont overpay for services
	* Automatically reduce resources when demand drops
* Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
	* Horizontal = adding additional VMs/containers
		* "Scaling out"
	* Vertical = increasing power of existing VMs
		* "Scaling up"

## Predictability
* Predictable performance and costs
* Performance
	* Consistent experience for customers regardless of traffic
	* Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability provide consistent experience
* Costs
	* No unexpected surprises
	* Track and forecast resource usage in real time
	* Analytics provide patterns/trends to optimise usage

## Management
* Security
	* Full control of the security of your cloud environment.
	* Patches, maintenance, network control and more
* Governance
	* Standardized environments
	* Regulatory requirements
	* Audit for compliance
* Manageability
	* Management of the cloud
		* Autoscaling
		* Monitoring
		* Template-based deployments
	* Management in the cloud
		* Portal
		* CLI
		* APIs
